= ptrans - rhq-metrics restServlet proxy

This is a proxy server taking in metrics data in several common formats and emitting
them as rest-requests into rhq-metrics backend for storage.

You can configure ports to use in a `ptrans.properties` file.

== Supported input formats

=== Syslog

This module contains a simple proxy server that also listens on UDP port 5140
for syslog messages. If a message is of the format

  type=metric thread.count=7 thread.active=5 heap.permgen.size=20000000

Then it is taken and the individual key-value-pairs are broken apart and
sent as individual metrics to a rhq-metrics rest server. The timestamp
is the current time on the proxy when the udp packet was received.

==== Configuring syslog

You need to configure syslog to forward you the messages.
For this you need to edit `/ec/syslog.conf` and add a line like this:

  *.info          @127.0.0.1:5140

(the facility and severity may vary depending on how your application is logging the metrics)

==== Manually testing

On a *nix command line you can run

  $ logger -p local3.info "type=metric thread.count=7 thread.active=5 heap.permgen.size=20000000"

to add entries to syslog for testing purposes.


=== Graphite

The converter also accepts Graphite plaintext format

    path value timestamp_in_s

or with multiple entries per message

    path1 value1 timestamp_in_s1
    path2 value2 timestamp_in_s2

=== Ganglia

If you have Ganglia `gmond` running, you can import its data by running the pTrans client, listening
to `gmond` udp mlticast packets.
For this to work, the packets from Ganglia need to have a large enough TTL to be seen on the host where you run pTrans.

Excerpt from gmond.conf:

----
udp_send_channel {
 mcast_join = 239.2.11.71
 port = 8649
 ttl = 4   <<--- Must be >> 1 if gmond is not on the host ptrans runs.
}
----

=== StatsD

The converter accepts statsD packets sent via UDP (to the UDP port).
Format is

  key:value|type


Where only key and value are accepted and the type is ignored (for now).

E.g.: `$ echo "my_time:100|ms" | nc -u4 localhost 8125`


== Running ptrans

You can use the provided `start.sh` script to start the server

Before you start the proxy, make sure the rest-server is running.


== Room for improvement:

* add information about the remote to the key so make the key unique
* reconnect to the rest server if it goes down
* add a syslog file tailer
* allow to start even if the rest server is not available
* allow for more syslog formats
* support reliable syslog protocol
