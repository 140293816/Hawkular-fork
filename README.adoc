# Build Instructions
This project has a dependency on Cassandra 2.x. A running Cassandra cluster, which can be a single node, is required for unit and integrationt tests.

1. Install link:https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm[ccm]
2. ccm create -v 2.0.7 rhq
3. ccm populate -n 1
4. ccm start
5. mvn install

These steps build and install a single node cluster of Cassandra 2.0.7. Any version of 2.x should suffice if you prefer a differen one. Note that while it is recommended to use ccm, it is not necessary. You just need to make sure you have a running 2.x cluster.
